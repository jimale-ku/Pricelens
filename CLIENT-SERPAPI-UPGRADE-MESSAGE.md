# Message to Client: SerpAPI Quota Upgrade Needed

## Quick Message (Copy & Send)

---

Hi [Client Name],

I've been testing the app extensively to ensure everything works perfectly for your demo, and during testing I've used up all the searches on your current SerpAPI account.

**Status:**
- ✅ Your SerpAPI API key is valid and working
- ⚠️ Account has reached the search limit (quota exhausted)
- 🔄 Need to upgrade plan to continue testing/demo

**What happened:**
During development and testing, I've been searching for products across multiple categories (groceries, electronics, clothing, etc.) to verify the app works correctly. This used up all available searches on the free/basic plan.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Upgrade your SerpAPI plan** at: https://serpapi.com/pricing
   - For testing/demo: **Starter Plan** ($50/month - 5,000 searches)
   - For production: **Business Plan** ($250/month - 25,000 searches)
   
2. **Or** I can use my own API key temporarily for the demo (I have one ready)

**Current Status:**
- Backend is live and working ✅
- App connects successfully ✅  
- Products will load once API quota is restored ✅

Let me know which option you prefer, and I'll get everything set up immediately!

## Alternative Shorter Version

Hi [Client Name],

Quick update: Your SerpAPI account has run out of searches (I've been testing extensively to make sure everything works perfectly for your demo).

**Options:**
1. Upgrade SerpAPI plan: https://serpapi.com/pricing
2. I can use my API key temporarily for the demo

Everything else is working great - backend is live and app connects successfully. Just need API quota restored to show products.

Let me know which you prefer!
