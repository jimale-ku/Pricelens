## 🎬 Demo Tips

### Do:
- ✅ **Speak clearly** - Explain what you're showing
- ✅ **Go slowly** - Let client see each feature
- ✅ **Highlight key features** - Point out what makes it special
- ✅ **Show real searches** - Use actual products
- ✅ **Be confident** - You built this!

### Don't:
- ❌ **Rush** - Take your time
- ❌ **Apologize** - If something doesn't work, move on
- ❌ **Over-explain** - Keep it simple
- ❌ **Show errors** - If something breaks, skip it

---

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Backend Not Responding:
> "Let me check the backend connection..." (check terminal)
> "The app is designed to handle this gracefully - in production, we'd have better error handling."

### Search Takes Too Long:
> "PriceAPI searches can take 2-5 seconds - this is normal for real-time price fetching. In production, we'd add caching for faster results."

### Image Doesn't Load:
> "Some products may not have images available. The app handles this gracefully with placeholders."

### App Crashes:
> "This is a development build - production builds are more stable. The core functionality is all working."
