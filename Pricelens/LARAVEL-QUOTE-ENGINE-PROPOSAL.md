# Upwork Proposal: Laravel Instant Quote Engine

Hi! I'd love to help you build your Instant Quote Engine with Laravel. I have extensive experience developing custom pricing calculators and complex backend logic in Laravel, including sequential multipliers, price floors, and rate limiting systems. I've successfully implemented similar quote engines that handle complex calculation sequences while maintaining clean, maintainable code.

I can deliver all the required features: the Laravel API quote calculator with your pricing rules, IP and email-based rate limits, PDF generation and email delivery, HubSpot integration for deals and contacts, Slack alerts, and GA4 event tracking. The frontend will be a clean, display-only interface for presenting quotes. I understand this is a fixed-scope project with a non-enterprise budget, and I'm ready to work within those constraints. Let's discuss the specific pricing logic requirements and I can provide a detailed timeline and estimate.
