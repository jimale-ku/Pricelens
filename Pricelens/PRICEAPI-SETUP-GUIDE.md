PriceLens - PriceAPI Setup Guide


What is PriceAPI?

PriceAPI is a service that provides real-time pricing data from over 100 online retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Home Depot, and many more stores.

Right now, your PriceLens backend uses mock/demo data for testing. To get real, live prices from actual stores, we need to subscribe to PriceAPI.
