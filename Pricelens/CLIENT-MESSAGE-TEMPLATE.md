**Subject:** PriceLens - Next Steps: PriceAPI Activation

Hi [Client Name],

Great meeting with you today! I'm excited that everything is looking good with the PriceLens backend.

### 🎯 Next Step: Activate Real Store Data

To move from demo data to **real, live prices** from 100+ stores (Amazon, Walmart, Target, etc.), we need to subscribe to PriceAPI.

**What is PriceAPI?**
It's a service that provides real-time pricing data from major retailers. This is what powers the price comparison feature of PriceLens.

**Investment:** Starting at $149/month (Growth Plan - recommended)
- 50,000 API calls per month (~1,600 searches/day)
- 14-day FREE trial
- Cancel anytime
- Covers all major stores

**Timeline:** Once you subscribe, I can integrate it in less than 1 hour, and we'll have live data!

### 📋 Simple Steps:

1. **Visit:** https://www.priceapi.com
2. **Sign up** and choose the Growth Plan ($149/mo)
3. **Start the free trial** (no charge for 14 days)
4. **Get your API key** from the dashboard
5. **Send me the API key** securely (email or encrypted message)

I've attached a detailed guide (PRICEAPI-SETUP-GUIDE.md) that walks through each step with screenshots.

### ⏱️ What Happens Next:

- You subscribe → Send me API key → I integrate (1 hour) → We test → **GO LIVE!**

Let me know if you have any questions or need help with the signup process. I'm here to assist!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
