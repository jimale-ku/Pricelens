# Message to Client

---

Hi [Client Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out to let you know that I'm unable to make our scheduled meeting today due to some urgent matters that came up. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

I would love to reschedule our meeting for **tomorrow at 7:00 AM Mountain Time**. This time works perfectly for me, and I'll be fully prepared to show you the progress on how the backend and frontend are working together.

**For today**, while I'm tied up, I wanted to make sure you can still review the project. You can access the codebase through my GitHub repository to explore:
- The project structure
- Backend API implementation
- Frontend components
- Integration points between frontend and backend
- Documentation files

**GitHub Repository:** [Your GitHub Link Here]

I've also prepared a document (attached) that outlines exactly what I'll be demonstrating in tomorrow's meeting, so you'll know what to expect.

Looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow at 7 AM MT to walk through everything!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
