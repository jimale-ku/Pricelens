# Assets Folder

## Logo File

**To add your custom logo:**

1. Save your logo image file as `logo.png` in this folder (`client/assets/logo.png`)
2. Recommended size: 512x512px or larger (for high quality)
3. Format: PNG (preferred) or JPG
4. After adding the file, restart your development server

The app will automatically use your logo once the file is added. Until then, it will show a fallback icon.
