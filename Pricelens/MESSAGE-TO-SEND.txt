Hi [Client Name],

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out to let you know that I'm unable to make our scheduled meeting today due to some urgent matters that came up. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.

I would love to reschedule for tomorrow at 7:00 AM Mountain Time. This works perfectly for me, and I'll be fully prepared to demonstrate how the backend and frontend are working together.

For today, while I'm tied up, you can review the project through my GitHub repository to explore the project structure, backend API implementation, frontend components, and integration points.

I've also attached a meeting agenda document that outlines exactly what I'll be showing you tomorrow, so you'll know what to expect.

Looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow at 7 AM MT!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
