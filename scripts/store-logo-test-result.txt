=== Store logo URL test ===

1. getStoreLogoUrl() always returns a URL:
   "Amazon" -> https://logo.clearbit.com/amazon.com ✓
   "Walmart" -> https://logo.clearbit.com/walmart.com ✓
   "Target" -> https://logo.clearbit.com/target.com ✓
   "Best Buy" -> https://logo.clearbit.com/bestbuy.com ✓
   "Unknown Store" -> https://logo.clearbit.com/unknownstore.com ✓
   "(empty)" -> https://via.placeholder.com/40?text=? ✓

2. Checking if a few logo URLs are reachable (HEAD request):
   amazon.com -> HTTP fetch failed
   walmart.com -> HTTP fetch failed
   target.com -> HTTP fetch failed

3. API response: stores and logos from backend
   Failed to fetch /stores: The operation was aborted due to timeout
   Failed to fetch /compare/multi-store: The operation was aborted due to timeout

=== Summary ===
Store icons/images are "returned" in the app by:
  - Backend may send store.logo; if not, we use getStoreLogoUrl(storeName)
  - getStoreLogoUrl always returns an HTTP URL (map, Clearbit, or placeholder)
  - StoreCard shows that URL and falls back to store initial if image fails to load
